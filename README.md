My pulsar data processing code for anyone to use and improve upon!

This code exists in two parts. The first is the actual code that I used while doing research, which was developed over many months of trial and error. The second is a set of jupyter notebooks and example files to guide a new user through the functionality of my code. 

NOTEBOOKS:
These are aimed at an auidience that is new to pulsar research and python. The difficulties of learning a programming language for the first time should not get in the way of good science, and it is to this end that I focussed myself on. It may be worth reading and executing a notebook multiple times to fully understand what is happening before diving into the scripts, especially if this is new for you. I also tried to explicity state when I was doing something because I didn't know a better method. 

There are also a few places where I have encouraged you to try editing the notebook yourself. This isn't entirely necessary, but will definitely aid in your understanding! 


NOTES ON RUNNING SCRIPTS AND NOTEBOOKS:
I have not included functionality for running either the scripts or notebooks multiple times. This is because we may want to make changes in the initial data processing steps, but may also want to be able to compare results later. The options were to either delete the old files, or check if they exist and save the new ones with a new naming scheme. I chose to do neither, as the first prevents us from making valuable comparisons, and the second will bury you in files. If you want to run these twice for one observation, I recommend moving the initial results to a new directory located above the code!

In order to start a notebook over from scratch, delete any files it has created and simply start from the beginning! :)
